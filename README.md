## #1 Electro Singer
**Electro Singer** is our first device built with adafruit circuit playground.  
It uses ports A1-A5 to detect tapping on 5 different veggies-  
avocado, guyava, clemantine, banana & potato!

Each tap changes the capacitivity values of the sensors and triggers a relevant sound.  
We used the light sensor to determine the music tone.  
With regular light we have medium tone. With extra light we have higher tone,   
and with little light we have low tone.  
The second output is led light. Any tap the code produces a different color.  

We chose to play "Little Yonatan", the beloved children's song.

  The circuit:
  * Ports A1-A5 are attached to the drum-fruits by alligators
  * The change in capacitivity in A1-A5 capacitivity sensors triggers the relevant sound
  * The amount of light determines the music tone
